# CAHD implementation

### Getting Started
Implementation of the CAHD algorithm (Correlation aware Anonymization of High-dimensional Data) to 
anonymize transactional data. First, the algorithm applies the RCM algorithm (Reverse Cuthill-McKee), to 
pre-process the data before the anonymization phase.


### Prerequisites
- Transactional data
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, Numpy, Scipy


### How to install the modules
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


### Executing the algorithm
Execute the command:
```
python Main.py
```
Interact with the program, providing it the requested inputs
